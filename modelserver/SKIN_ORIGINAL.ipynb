It\\'s also known as \"creeping eruption\" or \"larva migrans\".\\n\\n**Symptoms**\\nLesions on the feet, backside, and other areas likely to be exposed to contaminated soil or sand. Can occur anywhere on the body, but most often on areas like feet, buttocks, thighs, and hands.\\n\\n**Treatment**\\nCLM is self-limiting, meaning the larvae under the skin typically die off within 5-6 weeks without treatment. However, in some cases, it may take longer for the infection to go away. Medications can help speed up the healing process.\\n\\n**Prevention**\\nTo prevent infection, wear shoes, clothing that covers the thighs and buttocks, and avoid walking barefoot or sitting on the ground without a barrier. CLM is most common in warm areas like the southeastern United States, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any further questions!'}\n"
